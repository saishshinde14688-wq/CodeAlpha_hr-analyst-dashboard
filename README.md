# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard: Attrition & Employee Insights

**Author:** Saish Shinde

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Human Resources (HR) Analytics Dashboard** built using Power BI. The primary goal is to provide deep insights into employee data, with a special focus on understanding **Employee Attrition** (छोड़कर जाने वाले कर्मचारी) and key factors affecting the workforce.

The dashboard transforms raw HR data into actionable visual insights, enabling stakeholders (like HR Managers and Executives) to make data-driven decisions regarding talent retention, job satisfaction, and resource allocation.

## 📈 Key Dashboard Insights

The dashboard is designed to answer critical business questions:

1.  **Attrition Rate Analysis:** What is the overall attrition rate, and how does it trend across different departments and job roles?
2.  **Key Factors for Attrition:** What are the major drivers of attrition (e.g., Job Satisfaction, Income, Work-Life Balance, Overtime, Marital Status)?
3.  **Demographics & Performance:** Analysis of employee performance ratings, age distribution, and hourly/monthly income distribution.
4.  **Work Experience:** Insights into employee tenure (Years at Company, Years in Current Role) and its relation to attrition.
